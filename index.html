          <h3>PLAYING THE FLUTE</h3>
          <p>I have been playing the flute since 4th grade. I'm part of the Senior Orchestra at California Youth Symphony, and I have won awards like the 2020 USOMC 1st Place. I've also passed the ABRSM Grade 8 with distinction. I hope to continue playing in college and beyond!</p>

          <h3>SWIMMING</h3>
          <p>Swimming has always been an integral part of my life. Not only does it help me destress, but it also is a great way to exercise and stay in shape! I recently graduated from a swim club at Calphin. I still have lots to improve, but Im getting there!</p>
